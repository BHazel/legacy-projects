# Benedict Hazel's Legacy Projects

This repository contains a dump of legacy repositories and personal projects I have worked on over the years.  Each is stored in its own directory with its own readme and documentation, where there was any!

Single-file experiments and programs are stored in the _gists_ directory.

A couple of things to note:

* A lot of this code comes out of personal experiments and learning.
* It may appear that several of these legacy projects are reinventing the wheel!  I only discovered package managers such as NuGet in mid 2012!
* Anything coded prior to late 2012 was done while I was a university student.  Also, anything prior to about 2015 was while I was a junior developer.
* I have opted to not retain the history of legacy repositories and their latest Head condition is what is preserved here.
