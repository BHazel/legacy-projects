Read 1.0 Readme
===============

Read is a simple program to easily load and read README files on a UNIX-compliant system.
It works in a similar way to GNU make by searching a directory for a compatible file,
in this case a Readme file and loading it for reading using the less command.

The following readme filenames are recognised by Read:

    readme.txt
    README.txt
    README
    readme
    Readfile
    readfile

If multiple files are present, the first one (in the order of the list above) will be opened.

To open a readme file, simply use the following command in a directory containing a compatible file:

    read

It's as simple as that!

Installation
============

The standard installation pattern is followed for the compilation and installation of Read:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

To customise the output location for the installation, use the --prefix option on configure:

    ./configure --prefix=/location/to/install

By default, the C compiler used is the GNU compiler, gcc. This can be changed by setting the CC
environment variable on configure:

    ./configure CC=icc

Additional settings can be applied. Use the --help option on configure to see all:

    ./configure --help

Once installation is complete, add the bin directory to your PATH environment variable if
installation of Read was not to a standard location. Additionally, the manual page for Read
can be found in the share/man/man1 directory in the installation location.
