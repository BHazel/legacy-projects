Read supports a set of filenames for readme files in an order of precedence, i.e. whichever filename it finds first, Read will open that file regardless of whether multiple readme files are present.

The order of precedence of supported filenames is:

* readme.txt
* README.txt
* README
* readme
* Readfile
* readfile
