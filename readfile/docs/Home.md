**Project Description**
Read is a simple program to easily load and read README files on a UNIX-compliant system.

It works in a similar way to GNU Make by searching a directory for a compatible file, in this case a Readme file, and loading it for reading using a text editor or viewer.

Read is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

# Read Update

After nearly 10 months without an update, I am hoping to release a new version of Read in the coming month, including a major rewrite of most of the code as well as some new functionality. I hope to post more details soon!
