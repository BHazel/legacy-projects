Bool.h can be obtained by downloading the GZipped tarball from the Downloads section. Due to its simplicity, no Mercurial repository is available.

**GZipped Tarball File Extraction**

Extract the files from the GZipped tarball:
{{
tar -zxvf bool-X.Y.Z.B.tar.gz
}}
X.Y.Z.B refers to the version number of Read being installed. The files will extract to a folder named _bool-X.Y_.

Place the _bool.h_ file in global directory for Include files, or any necessary location for your solutions.
