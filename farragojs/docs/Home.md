**Project Description**
FarragoJS is a set of simple JavaScript functions offering features ranging from useful to totally pointless! But hey, there's a use for everything, right?

It is a JavaScript implementation of (bits of!) the BWHazel Web API, a RESTful interface written in C# and powered by ASP.NET Web API on Microsoft Azure.  This repository contains an open-source version of the code which can be used within your own sites!

I aim to continually add new functionality so check back regularly!

**What's Included?**
A summary of currently included functions are outlined below.  More details can be found in the Documentation section.  Those marked with a **(!)** might be quite useful!
* **Binary.js: (!)** Perform interconversion between binary and decimal numbers.
* **Nom.js:** Creates customisable and variable length _Om Nom Nom_ messages.  Includes jQuery plugin.
* **RecMaths.js:** Performs a selection of recreational maths functions.
* **Secret.js:** Converts text into secret messages via simple string manipulation.

The functions are written in TypeScript and can be downloaded as source or compiled JavaScript.

**Why?**
Good question!  JavaScript is taking over the world and it's a language that's mostly passed me by until now - .NET is my main development area!  The individual functions don't really merit their own repositories so I thought I would shove them all here together as a _mish-mash_, which is the meaning of the Latin word _Farrago_!
